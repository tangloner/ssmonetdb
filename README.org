* SQLsmith for MonetDB
    added SQLsmith Driver for MonetDB

** Description
SQLsmith is a random SQL query generator.


** Dependencies:
- C++11
- libpqxx // for postgresql
- boost::regex in case your std::regex is broken
- monetdb_mapi // for monetdb

** Building on Fedora

: cd ssmonetdb
: autoreconf -i 
: ./configure
: make
** Usage

SQLsmith connects to the target database to retrieve the schema for
query generation and to send the generated queries to.  Currently, all
generated statements are rolled back.  Beware that SQLsmith does call
functions that could possibly have side-effects
(e.g. pg_terminate_backend).  Use a suitably *underprivileged user*
for its connection to avoid this.

Example invocation:

: sqlsmith --verbose --monetdb="databasename"

The following options are currently supported:

| =--target=connstr=   | target postgresql database                       |
| =--monetdb=dbname=   | target monetdb database                          |
| =--log-to=connstr=   | database for logging errors (for postgresql only)|
| =--verbose=          | emit progress output                             |
| =--version=          | show version information                         |
| =--seed=int=         | seed RNG with specified integer instead of PID   |
| =--dry-run=          | print queries instead of executing them          |
| =--max-queries=long= | terminate after generating this many queries     |
| =--dump-all-graphs=  | dump generated ASTs for debugging                |

Sample output:

=--verbose= makes sqlsmith emit some progress indication to stderr.  A
symbol is output for each query sent to the server.  Currently the
following ones are generated:

| symbol | meaning           | details                                       |
|--------+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| .      | ok                | Query generated and executed with ok sqlstate |
| s      | syntax error      | These are bugs in sqlsmith - please report    |
| t      | timeout           | SQLsmith sets a statement timeout of 1s       |
| c      | broken connection | These happen when a query crashes the server  |
| e      | other error       |                                               |

It also periodically emits error reports.  In the following example,
these are mostly caused by the primitive type system.
